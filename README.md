## General Submission Instructions  
**Read Carefully**  
- You may refer to online resources (videos, articles, papers, etc.) and use their images to support your answers. **Provide the source** of any information used after each answer.  
- Submit the assignment in a **Google Drive folder** named `Subsystem_YourName_RollNo` and provide **viewing access** to everyone.  
- **Each answer should be submitted as a separate file.**  
- **Only PDF format is accepted.** Submissions containing links (Google Docs, Canva, etc.) will not be considered.  
- **You are not required to solve all questions to qualify for an interview.** Solve as many as you can within the given time.  
- The evaluation criteria focus on **learning ability, analytical precision, and problem-solving rigor**. If you cannot complete a question, write down the **logical steps** you would take.
